# Crypto-guard
Secure communication using asymmetric key and ciphertext


Modern communication systems heavily rely on secure and confidential exchange of information. To address the critical need for confidentiality and data integrity, ciphertext plays a pivotal role. 
This is achieved using ciphertext and 2 keys.
Overall this project aims to provide secure message passing.

## Problem statement :

Traditional communication methods are susceptible to eavesdropping and unauthorized access, leading to a need for a secure chatting system that is truly private and thus protect messages during transmission.
In Todayâ€™s day and age where data has become a commodity and internet a basic need , maintaining your privacy intact is becoming harder and harder. The same applies to commercial as well as government sector as the data the have is even so sensitive that if in wrong hands will surely create havoc.
